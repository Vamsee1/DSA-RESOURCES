# DSA-RESOURCES
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a vast topic, but you can break it down into manageable sections. Here's a rough roadmap of how much DSA you can learn based on the time you have:

### âœ… **1 Month** (Beginner Level - Basic Understanding)
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, HashMaps
- **Algorithms**: Basic Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort)
- **Concepts**: Time Complexity, Space Complexity, Basic Problem Solving
- **Practice**: Solve 20-30 beginner problems on platforms like LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks.

---

### âœ… **3 Months** (Intermediate Level - Solid Foundation)
- **Data Structures**: Trees, Graphs, Heaps, HashTables, Tries
- **Algorithms**: Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming (Basic), Divide & Conquer
- **Concepts**: Bit Manipulation, Greedy Algorithms, Sliding Window, Two Pointers
- **Practice**: Solve 100-150 problems of varying difficulty.

---

### âœ… **6 Months** (Advanced Level - Job Ready)
- **Data Structures**: Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
- **Algorithms**: Advanced Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), Dynamic Programming (Advanced)
- **Concepts**: Advanced Mathematical Concepts, KMP Algorithm, Trie Implementations
- **Practice**: Solve 300+ problems, participate in contests on Codeforces or CodeChef.

---

### ðŸ”Ž **Pro Tips for Learning DSA Efficiently**
- Start with easy problems, then gradually move to medium and hard.
- Practice pattern-based questions (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, etc.).
- Track your progress using platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.
- Participate in mock interviews or coding challenges.

Since you're aiming for Java developer roles, focusing on **Java Collections Framework**, **OOPs Concepts**, and applying DSA in Java would be beneficial. Would you like resources or a more detailed plan for a specific duration.
